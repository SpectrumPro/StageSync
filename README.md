# Stage Sync

Stage Sync is a program with a primary focus on simplifying the execution of live shows and productions. This tool seamlessly interconnects audio, lighting, and live streaming systems, providing users with effortless access and centralized control.

## Features

- **Seamless Interconnection:** Stage Sync links audio, lighting, live streaming, and much more, for a cohesive production experience.

- **Centralized Control:** Users can easily manage all aspects of their production from a centralized site, ensuring a streamlined workflow.

- **Versatile Control Options:** With the ability to create buttons, macros, sliders, input, and more, Stage Sync offers a wide range of control options.

- **TCP/UDP Integration:** Stage Sync uses comprehensive TCP/UDP integration, allowing every item in the user interface to trigger a wide array of TCP/UDP requests. This functionality enables versatile control, allowing Stage Sync to manage and interact with almost any software in your production environment.

## Early Development

Stage Sync is currently in an EXTREMELY early stage of development, much like all Spectrum products. The version currently on GitHub is my internal dev test and was used to control a set number of lights only. Development may be slow as I am putting most of my time into making Spectrum.

Feel free to explore the potential of Stage Sync and stay tuned for updates as we continue to refine and enhance its capabilities.
